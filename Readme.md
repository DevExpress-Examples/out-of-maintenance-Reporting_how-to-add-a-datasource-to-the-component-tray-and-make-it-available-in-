# How to add a datasource to the Component Tray and make it available in the Property Grid of the End-User Designer


<p>The following example demonstrates how to manually add components to the <i>designer host</i> of the End-User Report Designer. This may be required, for instance, if a report initially isn't bound to data, and data components are provided to it later - either after calling the <strong>XRDesignFormEx.OpenReport</strong> method or after clicking a custom button in the End-User Designer. In this case, data components will not be displayed in the Component Tray, and it will be impossible to assign them to a report's DataSource and DataAdapter properties until they are added to the <i>designer host</i>.</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To solve this task, it is necessary to handle the <strong>XRDesignFormEx.DesignPanel.DesignerHostLoaded</strong> event and call the <strong>ReportDesigner.AddToContainer</strong> method in this event handler for every data component, you want to add to the designer host.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to remove any items from the designer host, call the <strong>ReportDesigner.RemoveFromContainer</strong> method.</p>
